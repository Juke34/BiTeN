/* This file list the tool/container to use for each process that either have the mentioned label
* via the keyword withLabel: 'label' or usng withName: 'processName'
* The label allows to set a container for different process in one go.
* /!\ Keep in mind that every tool in conda has its counterpart in container. 
* Good places to look at the containerscorresponding to the tool you need are:
*    - https://biocontainers.pro/registry
*    - https://quay.io
*    - https://hub.docker.com
*    - A git repository can also shares a container image
